This extension was creating following a tutorial on Medium.com Created by Sara Wegman.

The purpose is to allow the user to add their name into storage and then greet them whenever they open a new tab.

Outside of what was provided in the tutorial, I added multiple greetings that are selected randomly. I also added the ability to experience some peace and tranquility if necessary (Credited to Gear for Breakfast / A Hat In Time).

At this time, I will not be adding this to the Chrome Web Store. I would like to continue working on it as practice for creating extensions and working with vanilla javascript.

For this build I had to include the video file in with the rest of the files. I will work on making the video dependent on YouTube for the next commit.
